### [go-anki](https://github.com/Aerex/go-anki)

Interact with Anki from the terminal


## Motivation
I use Anki-Droid a lot but making flash cards on the phone can be a pain. There is the desktop app but I am more of a CLI guy so I decided to create one. Intially, I wanted to create an API to interface with the CLI but there is no official API currently. There is [dsnopek/anki-sync-server](https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server) but it is very limited. My plan is to make the CLI compatible with Anki 2.157+ so that users can sync their decks like any other official client.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/Aerex/go-anki
